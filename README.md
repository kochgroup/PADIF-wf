# PADIF Decoys Test

This code is used for testing different decoy options to create a specific target scoring function based on **PADIF** (*Protein Per Atom Score Contributions Derived Interaction Fingerprint*) as presented in [*Efficient Decoy Selection to Improve Virtual Screening Using Machine Learning Models*](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2hh8z).

Docking files for each target are located in *files/docking_solutions* folder. Please decompress this file to have a complete view.
